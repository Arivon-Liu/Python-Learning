# what is computation

Turing showed that you can compute anything using 6 primitives

a programming language provides a set of primitive operations

expressions are complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language

## primitive constructs
- English: words
- programming language: numbers, strings, simple operators

## syntax
- English: 


	"cat dog boy" ---- not syntactically valid
	"cat hugs boy" ---- syntactically valid


- programming language:
    
	
	"hi"5 ---- not syntactically valid
    3.2*5 ---- syntactically valid

## static semantics is which syntactically valid strings have meaning
- English: 
              
		"I are hungry" ---- syntactically valid but static semantic error

- programming language: 
                        
					   3.2*5 ---- syntactically valid
                       
                       3+"hi" ---- static semantic error
