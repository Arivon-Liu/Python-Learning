# what is computation

Turing showed that you can compute anything using 6 primitives

a programming language provides a set of primitive operations

expressions are complex but legal combinations of primitives in a programming language

## primitive constructs
- English: 

			words
- programming language: 

			numbers, strings, simple operators

## syntax
- English: 


			"cat dog boy" ---- not syntactically valid
			"cat hugs boy" ---- syntactically valid


- programming language:
    
	
			"hi"5 ---- not syntactically valid
			3.2*5 ---- syntactically valid

## static semantics is which syntactically valid strings have meaning
- English: 
              
			"I are hungry" ---- syntactically valid but static semantic error

- programming language: 
                        
			3.2*5 ---- syntactically valid
                       
			3+"hi" ---- static semantic error
			
**Progrmming languages can have only one meaning**


## Objects

Python Programs manipulate data Objects

All Objects have a **type**

- Objects:

			Scalar Objects;
			non-Scalar objects
### Scalar Objects
+ int
+ Float
+ bool
+ NoneType

**can use type() to see the type of an object**

**int and float can convert objects to another**


## expressions

1. combine **objects** and **operators** to form expressions
2. an expression has a value,which has a type

- syntax

			<object> <oprator> <object>

## Binding variables ans values

**equal sign is an assignment of a value to a variable name**

			pi = 3.14159
			pi_approx = 22/7
